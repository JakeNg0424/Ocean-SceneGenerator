# Ocean
This project offers a generative, living impression of this inspiring image:

Relation to inspring image:

- Color: The clouds and the sun are white and yellow as they usually appear to be in this image. The color of the sky and waves of the ocean are different shades of blue I picked from a color pallete to best distinguished their layers.
- Primitives: The clouds and the sun are both rendered with `ellipse` primitives.
- Polygons: The foreground ocean waves are two single randomly polygon using `vertex` calls.
- Composition: Different random seed values lead to differently shaped wave currents of the ocean and differently positioned clouds.
- Life: The position of the clouds is animated over time as if to simulate the them blowing in the wind and the slightly responds to the horizontal motion of the mouse cursor.
